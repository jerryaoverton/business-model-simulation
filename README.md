# Using Data Science for Business Model Innovation

## Overview
This repository contains projects used in the O’Reilly Media Learning Path training video entitled *Using Data Science for Business Model Innovation*. This learning path is for data professionals and business leaders interested in using data science for business model innovation. 

When done right, business innovation can be technical/scientific problem. Solving this problem means learning the mathematical language of prescriptive model simulation. Once learned, these concepts can be used to simulate innovations and new business models. In the learning path, w
We cover methods for building prescriptive model simulations with examples for how to simulate IOT, consumers,  companies, and smart cities. Participants will learn the essentials of prescriptive modeling, how to simulate new business model innovations, enterprise-scale simulation, and best practices for making simulation a reality.

## Heading 1
We can simulate interactions among people. By taking data about the interactions between healthcare providers and patients, we can simulate new patient experiences. We can use those simulated experiences to discover new ways hospitals can improve patient care.

## Heading 2
We can simulate smart interactions among networks of things. By taking data about the power consumption of household devices, we can simulate a conversation between your refrigerator and water heater, your water heater and television, your television and toaster. We can use those simulations to discover ways for household devices to cooperate and lower energy consumption on behalf of homeowners.

## Heading 3
We can simulate people's interactions with companies. By taking data about the services that a company provides and their customer's reaction, we can simulate new company-customer interactions. We can use those simulations to discover new ways for companies to make its customers happy.

## Heading 4
We can simulate how people form and interact within communities. By taking census data about how people spend their time, we can simulate the activities of those most engaged in volunteering and civic leadership. We can use those simulations to discover ways that companies can improve their brand by improving their engagement within the community.
